Encouraging senteces:


In my videogame I am creating there is a character that is a war sergeant. It is saying encouraging sentences to the soldiers one by one before send them to the front, sentences like "You can do it, kiddo", "Our hope is on you, boy", "You can do this", "Use your training" ... I need another 20 encouraging sentences like this
